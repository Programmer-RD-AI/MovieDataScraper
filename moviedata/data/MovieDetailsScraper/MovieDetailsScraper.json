That's how you depict somebody intensely writing. But I thought, 'We can't have that. It's tropey and silly, and it doesn't get the audience's minds going.' So why not have these characters manifest in front of him? When I wrote that scene, I wrote the language to be very silly. It had to be ridiculous so that everybody could see how stupid this book is and what a sham it is. Then we got Keith David and Okieriete Onaodowan, who are both such tremendous actors. All of the sudden, it wasn't silly anymore. They made it seem like the book might be good. I love what the scene became in their hands: suddenly you're questioning whether or not the book is good, which is evidence that something as ridiculous as this book could become a hit.\"",

Carrey waited for a full year for the production to start; then he dropped off, and the role went to Nicolas Cage in 2015.

Their request was denied. The project stopped until 2021 when Zac Efron and Amazon became interested in the script. Finally, John Cena was cast as Ricky Stanicky.",
